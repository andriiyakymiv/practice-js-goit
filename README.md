# JavaScript Practice - Course Fullstack GoIT.

---

**This repository contains JavaScript practice exercises and code examples,
covering different levels of difficulty from basic to advanced. It is intended
for those who want to improve their programming skills, put theoretical
knowledge into practice, and prepare for real-world projects or interviews.**

## What's Inside?

### Beginner Level - Introduction to JavaScript fundamentals:

- Variable declarations (let, const, var)
- Using operators (if...else, switch, ternary)
- Loops (for, while, do...while)
- Function basics (declaration, invocation, arrow functions)

### Intermediate Level - Working with data structures and objects:

- Arrays and their methods (map, filter, reduce, sort)
- Working with objects and nested structures
- Understanding this and execution context
- Basics of module usage (import, export)

### Advanced Level - Diving deeper into JavaScript:

- Asynchronous programming (async/await, fetch, Promise)
- API interaction and error handling (try...catch, error management)
- Object-oriented JavaScript (classes, prototypes)
- Code optimization and advanced techniques (closures, currying)

### Additional Challenges - Algorithmic problem-solving:

- Sorting and searching algorithms (bubble sort, binary search)
- Recursion and tree structures
- Project-based tasks (TODO list, calculator, interactive UI components)
